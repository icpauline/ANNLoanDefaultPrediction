# Loan Default Prediction
## Introduction
For companies like Lending Club correctly predicting whether or not a loan will be a default is very important. In this project, using the historical data from 2007 to 2015, you have to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans. As you will see later this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that make this problem more challenging.
## Task:
Analysis to be done: Perform data preprocessing and build a deep learning prediction model. 
## Approach:
1.	Imported data
2.	Performed Data Cleaning
3.	Performed feature transformation
4.	Carried out Exploratory Data Analysis
5.	Performed feature Engineering
6.	Performed Feature Scaling
7.	Balanced the dataset using SMOTE technique
8.	Normalized the data
9.	Created the model using Artificial Neural Network
10.	Created model had given an accuracy of 76%
